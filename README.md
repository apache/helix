## WHAT IS HELIX

Helix is a generic cluster management framework used for automatic management of partitioned, replicated and distributed resources hosted on a cluster of nodes. Helix provides the following features: 

1. Automatic assignment of resource/partition to nodes
2. Node failure detection and recovery
3. Dynamic addition of Resources 
4. Dynamic addition of nodes to the cluster
5. Pluggable distributed state machine to manage the state of a resource via state transitions
6. Automatic load balancing and throttling of transitions
