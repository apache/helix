This directory contains the YAML manifests for Kubernetes
objects, Dockerfiles for Docker images of Helix components,
and the Python script for visualization used in the demo for
elastic Task Framework. Note that this demo dynamically loads
the task it runs. If you want statically loaded tasks, you
need to register the task you want to execute in the
org.apache.helix.manager.zk.ParticipantManager constructor.
To run the demo, follow these steps:

1. Start a Kubernetes cluster. You can use Minikube for the
   purposes of this demo. In that case, if it is not already
   installed, you should first by following directions found
   at https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-minikube/

2. Run the following commands. Wait for the Kubernetes objects
   related to each command to stabilize before you run the
   commands in the next step. You can check the status of the
   objects in the Kubernetes dashboard. If you are using
   minikube, you can access the dashboard by running
   "minikube dashboard" in a separate terminal.

   You also need to have kubectl installed to run these
   commands. Instructions to do so can be found at:
   https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/

   a. Deploy ZooKeeper:
      > kubectl apply -f helix-zookeeper-deployment.yaml

   b. Deploy REST server:
      > kubectl apply -f helix-rest-deployment.yaml

   c. Create a cluster called "MYCLUSTER" and add Helix
      Controller and Participant Deployments to it:
      > curl -X PUT http://172.17.0.3:30000/admin/v2/clusters/MYCLUSTER
      > kubectl apply -f helix-controller-deployment.yaml
      > kubectl apply -f helix-participant-deployment.yaml

   d. Deploy custom metrics server and create Horizontal Pod
      Autoscaler. Source code for custom metrics server and
      instructions on how to build it can be fount at
      https://github.com/rabashizade/custom-metrics-apiserver
      > kubectl apply -f testing-adapter.yaml
      > kubectl apply -f hpa.yaml

3. (Optional) Run plot.py in a separate terminal for
   visualization.

4. Run the test script in
   org.apache.helix.task.TestElasticScaling.
