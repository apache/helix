Release Notes for Apache Helix 0.9.9

  The Apache Helix team would like to announce the release of Apache Helix 0.9.9.

  This is the twenty-fourth release under the Apache umbrella, and the twentieth as a top-level project.

  Helix is a generic cluster management framework used for the automatic management of partitioned, replicated and distributed resources hosted on a cluster of nodes.

  In this release, Helix provides several interface improvements and bug fixes:

[]

* Key Note for Helix Release

** New Feature

    In this release, we added Helix participant auto registration feature for cloud environment, e.g. Azure. With this feature, a Helix participant can automatically get its fault domain information from cloud provider, and join the cluster with this information when participant starts. We also provide domain APIs which allow users to retrieve the topology of the cluster as well as the mapping between each fault domain and the instances inside that domain.

* Detailed Changes

** New Feature

    * Add JAVA API and REST API for cluster creation with cloudconfig (#675, #872, #882, #898)

    * Modify participant manager to add cluster auto registration logic (#695)

    * Add Helix cloud interface and high level implementation methods (#600)

    * Implement Azure cloud instance information processor to support auto registration in Azure environment (#698)

    * Add Helix cluster trie structure and provide domain APIs based on the trie to retrieve cluster topology and domain information. (#1307, #1416)
